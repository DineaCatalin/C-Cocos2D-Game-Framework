# C++-Cocos2D-Game-Framework

This is the project where I play with different patterns and modules of a game framework by using C++ and Cocos2D.
It contains the skelleton that is made on the MVC patters with Observer Pattern. 
There is also a custom Memory Manager for more optimized memory allocations.
